http://dctraintracker.com has identified the circuit ID's between stations. /u/SandBoxJohn has created https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?dg=feature&msa=0&mid=19K1NsQVZDfygg4M_jasXUV8f_-o and https://i.imgur.com/9ibKR3t.png. The former identifies the track chain markings/chaninings which should indicate where individual circuits are. Otherwise, they can be approximated by determining the distance between stations and dividing that number by the number of circuits there are (using DCTT). Using Google's Maps API, it should be possible to script the placement of POI markers marking the beginning of each circuit in between stations on top of SBJ's Google Maps map. The WSG84 coordnates for each POI could then be extracted and stored in a GeoJSON blob.
